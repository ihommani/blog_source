ihommani.github.io
==================

Yet another technical blog


For generating my github-pages I use the static blog generator **Pelican**.
All the files (except the content) are generated by the "pelican-quickstart" command.
It provides a skelleton, we can complete according our needs.

This repo contains the blog sources. Since github does not natively support Pelican, we have to deport the sources
from the github-pages repo. 
Once generated, the output directory can be published as github-pages i.e pushed in the gh-pages repo.
The practical tool ghp-import allow to do this transparently.
The named repo *ihommani.github.io* is the result of the output produced by the present repo.


The below lines describes the different steps to trigger in order to publish the blog.

$ pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py
$ ghp-import output
$ git push git@github.com:yourName/yourName.github.io.git gh-pages:master


PS: The commit history of *ihommani.github.io* do not reflect the true historic. Instead it is the present commit history which reflect the different steps through which the blog evolves.
